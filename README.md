# JavaScript + Express

Some Express-server testing.

Back-end for my react testing. 
https://github.com/JaakkoP1998/react_harjoittelua for front-end.

Website is working and running in Render: https://react-express-practice.onrender.com/

Note: I am using Render's free version, so application might take a while to start running.
There is also limited time that service can be used for free every month, so application can stop working
completely for a while.
